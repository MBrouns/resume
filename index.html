        <p><p>As an IT professional I&rsquo;ve held various roles, including CTO, Technical lead/trainer, Software Development Manager,
Data-, Machine Learning- &amp; Software Engineer. I&rsquo;m especially interested in building high performance teams by providing them
with the right set of skills, tools, processes and autonomy. I love sharing knowledge and I&rsquo;m often on stage at
conferences and meetups to do exactly that.</p>
<p>As Xccelerated’s CTO, I hold final responsibility for the technological strategy of the organisation. This includes
identifying significant niches such as MLOps and Cloud FinOps to establish our expertise in,
driving organizational adaptations to leverage these opportunities, and proactively seeking new partnerships and
clients to drive sustainable growth.</p>
<p>Together with the CEO, I actively manage the day-to-day operations of the organisation and assume budgetary accountability
for our cell of 70 FTE. I&rsquo;m heavily involved in the technical development of all our consultants and trainers. This starts at  recruiting and
assessing new hires and continues with training and mentoring them on the job. Next to that, I&rsquo;m a solution lead and principal at several of our partners,
where I help them with Data- and Cloud migrations, IT Team development and Agile Methodologies.</p>
<p>I thrive in small, motivated and highly skilled teams, be it at work, or in my spare time
when I&rsquo;m executing deep, complex SCUBA dives extracting abandoned fishing nets from wrecks and reefs.
The agility of and straightforward collaboration within these teams is vital to get difficult things done.</p>
<p>Volunteering has always played an important role in my life. Currently I hold the role of chair
of the PyData Amsterdam conference and meetup. I also love being active in open source development and maintain
several packages in the Data and ML ecosystem (scikit-lego &amp; timeseers) as well as contribute to others like PyMC3 and scikit-learn.</p>

<ul>
<li>Designed and built two event-based real-time data integration solutions between clients’ ERP systems and our in-house built planning solutions</li>
<li>Built and deployed several Machine Learning models that facilitated planning and scheduling of liquid bulk terminals</li>
<li>Implemented a mature DevOps workflow</li>
<li>Managed and extended a team of 6 software developers.</li>
<li>Increased the percentage of projects on time from 40% to 85%.</li>
<li>Increased average client satisfaction by 2 points out of 10.</li>
<li>Increased codebase quality by introducing code reviews and individual educational tracks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because of these changes, the software development department was able to have its first profitable year. Apart from managing the team I remained active as a developer implementing various microservices for predictive analytics and scheduling algorithms at liquid bulk terminals</p>
